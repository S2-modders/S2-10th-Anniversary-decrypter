# The Settlers II 10th Anniversary and RoC/AdK decrypter/encrypter

decrypts and encrypts the assets of The Settlers II 10th Anniversary.

## Notes

- you need at least C++ 17 to be able to compile it
- if you installed the game in the default folder the program won't be able to save the decrypted file in that location because it doesn't have sufficient rights

## Usage

```bash
S2decryptor <file/folder>
```

## Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work for you:

1. maybe it doesn't have permission to create a file in that location; try copying what you want to decrypt to your desktop and try again.
2. try using it with cmd to see the error log.
